//merge sort is based on divide and conquer algorithm.
//It divides the input into two parts, calls itself for the two parts, and then merges the sorted array.
//It calls two functions:
//1. Merge() : This function is called to merge the two halves
//2. mergeSort() : this function is recursively called two divide the array into two halves till the size of the arrays
//becomes 1.
